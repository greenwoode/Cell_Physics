Currently crashes due to passing refferences that garbage collection follows and deletes instead of passing values. Easy fix but time ran out.

### Installing:

1. Open the project file `ConsoleApplciation1.sln` in Visual Studio 2017, or a later version with the 2017 c++ compiler installed.
2. Link the Visual Studio project to a local [Visual C++ 15 (2017) - 64-bit](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/) installation.
3. Build the project, and ensure the files located in the `?\SFML\bin` folder are coppied next to the newly compiled `.exe` file.
4. Run the executable!
